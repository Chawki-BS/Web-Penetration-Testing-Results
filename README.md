# Web-Penetration-Testing-Results
This web penetration testing assessment (http://testphp.vulnweb.com) is part of my university <b>"TEK-UP University"</b> projects that I'm asked to do.
## Requirements
To perform this web penetration testing assessment, you will need the following tools:
- Nikto: A web server scanner that can be used to identify potential vulnerabilities in web servers and web applications.
- Burp Suite: A web application security testing tool that can be used to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in web applications.
- OWASP ZAP: An open-source web application security scanner that can be used to automatically discover vulnerabilities in web applications.
- Nmap: A network mapping and security scanning tool that can be used to discover hosts and services on a network.
- OpenVAS: An open-source vulnerability assessment tool that can be used to identify and classify security vulnerabilities in networks and web applications.
## Methodology
The web penetration testing assessment will be conducted using the OWASP Top 10 as a classification scheme to identify and report security vulnerabilities in the website. Additionally, we will be using the OWASP-Web-Checklist to ensure comprehensive coverage of web application security testing techniques. The assessment will be conducted in several stages, including:
- Reconnaissance: Gather information about the target website and its infrastructure using tools like Nmap and Google Dorks.
- Vulnerability Identification: Identify potential vulnerabilities in the website using tools like Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP.
- Exploitation: Attempt to exploit any identified vulnerabilities using tools like Metasploit.
- Reporting: Document any vulnerabilities that were identified and exploited in a report, classified according to the OWASP Top 10.
## Usage
To use this repository, simply clone it to your local machine to see the results in HTML format and follow the steps outlined in the Methodology section above.
## Reporting
The results of the web penetration testing assessment will be documented in a report, classified according to the OWASP Top 10. The report will also include a checklist of testing techniques performed based on the OWASP-Web-Checklist. The report will be included in the repository once complete.
## Conclusion
The objective of this web penetration testing assessment is to identify and report security vulnerabilities in the website http://testphp.vulnweb.com using the OWASP Top 10 classification scheme and the OWASP-Web-Checklist.
